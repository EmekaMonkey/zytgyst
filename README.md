#### About
A game made in the [Juno]( www.github.com/rxi/juno) game framework, with Lua

#### Building
First, install Python. When you have that installed run `./build.py` or `python build.py` in the root directory, and then visit the `bin` folder. If you are using linux you **must** have SDL 1.2 and Luajit 5.1.2.0.4 installed for it to build properly.
